# Evidence: Incoming (SMSG) Pipeline

This directory contains raw decompiled C code snippets for the core components of the incoming (Server-to-Client) message pipeline. These functions represent the generic machinery responsible for receiving, decrypting, deframing, and dispatching messages from the Game Server.

They serve as the primary source evidence for the descriptions of the SMSG pipeline in the main [System Architecture](../../system-architecture.md) document.
