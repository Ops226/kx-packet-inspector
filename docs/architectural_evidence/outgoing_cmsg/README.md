# Evidence: Outgoing (CMSG) Pipeline

This directory contains raw decompiled C code snippets for the core components of the outgoing (Client-to-Server) message pipeline. These functions represent the generic machinery responsible for building, serializing, and sending messages to the Game Server.

They serve as the primary source evidence for the descriptions of the CMSG pipeline in the main [System Architecture](../../system-architecture.md) document.
