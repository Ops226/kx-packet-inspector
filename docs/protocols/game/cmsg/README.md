# CMSG Packet Reference (Game Server)

This directory contains documentation for Client-to-Server packets that have been **fully validated against live network traffic**. Each packet's structure and builder function have been confirmed through dynamic analysis.

For packets that have a known schema or builder but have not been observed or confirmed in common gameplay, see the [Unverified Packets](./unverified/README.md) directory.
