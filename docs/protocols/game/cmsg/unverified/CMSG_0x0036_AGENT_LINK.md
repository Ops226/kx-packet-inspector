# CMSG_AGENT_LINK (0x0036)

**Direction**: Client -> Server
**Status**: Confirmed Builder (Schema-Driven), Unobserved in Live Traffic

## Summary

This packet is designed to link two agents together (e.g., a pet to a character). Its structure is defined by a schema, and a dedicated builder function exists in the client. However, this packet has not been observed during normal gameplay, suggesting it is used in very specific contexts or is legacy code.

## Construction

*   **Builder Function:** `CMSG::BuildAgentLink`
