# CMSG 0x0051 â€” Unknown (24-byte buffer payload)

Status: Confirmed opcode and total payload size. Name TBD.

## Summary

A Client-to-Server packet with opcode `0x0051` is emitted with a 24-byte (0x18) buffer payload seeded from a pointer argument.

## Evidence

Emitter: CMSG_Build_0x0051_BufferLen24_FromPtr @ 0x140245480

Decompiled highlights:
```
local_28[0] = *param_2;     // seed buffer from pointer input
local_38   = 0x18;          // length = 24 bytes
MsgConn::QueuePacket(DAT_142628800, 0, 0x51, local_28);
```

Notes:
- The immediate opcode is `0x51`.
- The `local_38 = 0x18` establishes the payload length (24 bytes).
- The payload pointer is `local_28`; its first 8 bytes are seeded from `*param_2`.

## Payload (current understanding)

Likely structure (opaque buffer):
```
struct CMSG_0x0051_Payload {
    uint8_t data[24]; // seeded from a source pointer (param_2), exact field semantics TBD
};
```

Open questions:
- Exact field semantics within the 24-byte block.
- Whether additional emitters exist that vary composition of this block.

## Confidence

- Opcode: High (direct `QueuePacket(..., 0x51, ...)` with immediate size constant).
- Size: High (0x18 explicitly set).
- Field semantics: Unknown.
