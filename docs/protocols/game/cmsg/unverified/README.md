# Unverified CMSG Packets

This directory contains documentation for CMSG packets that have a lower confidence level. This includes:
- Packets where a builder function has been confirmed but have not been observed in common live gameplay.
- Packets where only a schema is known, with no confirmed builder or live traffic.
