# Web Interface Decompilations

This directory contains raw decompiled C code snippets related to the game's embedded web browser interface.

These functions typically act as a bridge between the native game client (C++) and the JavaScript environment running within the web view (e.g., for the Trading Post, Gem Store, or other web-based UI elements).

Examples include:
*   Registering native game functions as JavaScript API endpoints.
*   Handling callbacks or events from the web view.
