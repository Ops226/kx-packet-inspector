# Engine Core Decompilations

This directory contains raw decompiled C code snippets related to the core game engine components, high-level dispatchers, and fundamental system handlers.

These functions represent critical parts of the game's internal architecture that are not directly tied to specific network message directions (CMSG/SMSG) but rather manage broader game systems, events, or command processing.

Examples include:
*   Central command dispatchers.
*   Core event system components.
*   High-level game state management.
