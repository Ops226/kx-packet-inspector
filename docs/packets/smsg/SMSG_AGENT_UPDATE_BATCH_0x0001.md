# SMSG_AGENT_UPDATE_BATCH (0x0001)

**Direction:** Server -> Client
**Status:** Confirmed Container Packet (Complex "Fast Path" Dispatch)

## Summary

`SMSG 0x0001` is not a single packet type but a **high-frequency container packet** used to bundle various agent-related events into a single stream. It is one of the most common packets received during gameplay, handling events like agent movement, state changes, and despawns.

This packet is handled by a special **"Fast Path"** inside the main `Msg::DispatchStream` function. This path bypasses the generic schema-driven parsing system in favor of a highly optimized, hardcoded dispatch mechanism to maximize performance for these common world-state updates.

## Evidence of Container Nature

The conclusion that this is a container packet is based on several key pieces of evidence from dynamic analysis:

1.  **Multiple Handlers:** Live debugging shows that opcode `0x0001` is dispatched to at least six different "notification" handler functions (e.g., `FUN_141017dd0`, `FUN_141018580`, etc.).
2.  **Variable Payload Sizes:** Captured logs show this packet with many different sizes (9, 14, 25, 26, 38, 44, 62 bytes), which is inconsistent with a single, fixed-structure packet.
3.  **Unique Dispatch Type:** Analysis of `Msg::DispatchStream` shows that the `Handler Info` structure for opcode `0x0001` has a "Dispatch Type" of `1`. This value triggers the "Fast Path" logic, which calls the handler with only a single argument (the context), ignoring the generic parsed-data pipeline.

## The Full Dispatch Flow (Corrected Understanding)

The processing of this packet occurs on a "Fast Path" that differs significantly from most other packets.

1.  **`Msg::DispatchStream` Identifies Fast Path:** The main dispatcher reads the opcode `0x0001` and retrieves its `Handler Info` structure. It checks the "Dispatch Type" field (at offset `+0x10`) and sees the value `1`, identifying it as a Fast Path packet.

2.  **Minimal Parse for Subtype:** `Msg::DispatchStream` still calls `MsgUnpack::ParseWithSchema`, but the schema for `0x0001` is likely minimal, only parsing the first few bytes of the payload (the **subtype ID** and **agent ID**) into a temporary structure.

3.  **`switch` on Subtype:** The function then uses this parsed `subtype ID` in a large internal `switch` statement or jump table to select the correct block of code to handle that specific agent event.

4.  **Manual Payload Parsing:** Inside each `case` of the `switch`, `Msg::DispatchStream` contains the **hardcoded logic** to manually parse the rest of that specific subtype's payload. It calls its internal utility function, `FUN_140fd70a0` (a ring buffer reader), multiple times to read floats, integers, etc., directly from the raw network buffer.

5.  **Direct State Update:** After parsing the fields, the code within the `switch` case calls the appropriate game logic functions to directly update the agent's state (e.g., position, health, effects).

6.  **Final Notification Call (Previously Misidentified as Handlers):** After all the parsing and processing is complete, the dispatcher calls the function pointer registered for the `0x0001` opcode (e.g., `Event::PreHandler_Stub_0x88`). These functions accept no payload data because the data has already been fully processed. Their role is simply to notify other, more abstract game systems that a specific agent event has occurred.

## Investigation Note: The Event System Dead End

An earlier investigation theorized that the notification stubs (like `Event::PreHandler_Stub_0x88`) passed a sub-opcode to a generic `Event::Dispatcher_ProcessEvent` which would then look up the real handler in a table at `DAT_14263eb60`. **This theory was disproven.** Live debugging confirmed that this event table is never written to or read from during the processing of these high-frequency packets. While that event system is a valid part of the game engine, it is not used for the `SMSG 0x0001` packet stream. The entire logic is self-contained within `Msg::DispatchStream`.

## Hypothesized Payload Structure

Based on log analysis and the corrected architectural understanding, it is highly likely that all `0x0001` variants begin with a common header that is read by `Msg::DispatchStream`.

```cpp
#pragma pack(push, 1)
// Represents the common header at the start of every 0x0001 payload
struct SmsgAgentUpdateHeader {
    uint16_t subtype;   // The actual event type ID, used in the main switch
    uint16_t agentId;   // The agent this update applies to
    uint32_t tick;      // A server-side tick or timestamp for sequencing
};

// Example for a 26-byte movement packet, parsed inside its own 'case' block
struct SmsgAgentUpdate_Movement {
    SmsgAgentUpdateHeader header; // subtype would be 0x0040
    float pos_x;
    float pos_y;
    float pos_z;
    // ... plus other data like rotation, etc.
};
#pragma pack(pop)
```

## Next Steps to Fully Reverse Engineer

The path to fully decoding all variants of `0x0001` is now clear and relies on static analysis of a single function:

1.  **Analyze `Msg::DispatchStream` in Ghidra.**
2.  **Locate the main `switch` statement** that branches based on the subtype read from the packet header.
3.  **Analyze each `case` block individually.** Each block contains the hardcoded parsing logic for a specific agent event. By tracing the calls to the ring buffer reader (`FUN_140fd70a0`) and observing how the returned values are used, one can reconstruct the exact payload structure for every subtype.
