# SMSG 0x0045 — Attachment/Asset Install

Status: Confirmed (code-backed)

Dispatch Path:
- Dispatcher: FUN_14025DA50, case 0x45 (index = opcode − 0x2B)
- Schema: &DAT_142513D70 → passed to FUN_140FD4D50 (typed arg builder)
- Handler code slice (addresses approximate):
  - 0x14025EA86..0x14025EB3E

Behavior Summary:
- Finds/creates a target at param_1 + 0x128 with FUN_140257E70; if absent, calls FUN_1402541C0 to create.
- Copies a 16‑byte block from parsed tuple (+0x02/+0x12) into a destination built via FUN_140257CF0 at [target + 0x50] using &local_60 (assembled from +0x02/+0x0A/+0x12).
- Requires a non‑null pointer at [tuple + 0x26]; attaches it into [dest + 0x48] via FUN_140FFC0A0.

Key Instructions (evidence):
- FUN_140FD4D50(&DAT_142513D70) → RBX = tuple
- target = FUN_140257E70(param_1 + 0x128, (ulonglong*)(RBX + 0x16)); if 0 → error (guard)
- local_60 assembled:
  - local_60 = *(longlong**)(RBX + 0x02); uStack_58 = *(ulonglong*)(RBX + 0x0A); local_50 = *(u32*)(RBX + 0x12)
- dest = FUN_140257CF0(target + 0x50, &local_60); if 0 → error
- Require *(longlong*)(RBX + 0x26) != 0; then FUN_140FFC0A0(dest + 0x48, *(longlong*)(RBX + 0x26))

Field Layout (inferred from access pattern):
- +0x02: pointer A
- +0x0A: u64‑sized quantity B (or pair material)
- +0x12: u32 C (length/code)
- +0x26: pointer payload that must be non‑null and is attached into the destination object

Notes:
- This message attaches/installs an asset or sub‑resource into a preexisting object identified by (A,B,C). The handshake is strictly guarded by non‑null checks and builder returns.
