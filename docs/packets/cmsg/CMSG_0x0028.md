# CMSG 0x0028 — Unknown (16B params + 8B pointer = 24B)

Status: Confirmed opcode and total payload size. Name TBD.

## Summary

A Client-to-Server packet with opcode `0x0028` is emitted with a 24-byte payload composed of four 32-bit parameters followed by an 8-byte value (pointer/handle-like).

## Evidence

Emitter: CMSG_Build_0x0028_Params16_Ptr8 @ 0x140239120

Decompiled highlights:
```
local_18 = param_5;        // u32 saved separately (part of payload via aliasing)
local_10 = param_6;        // u64 saved separately (last 8 bytes)

local_28 = param_1;        // first u32
local_24 = param_2;        // second u32
local_20 = param_3;        // third u32
local_1c = param_4;        // fourth u32

MsgConn::QueuePacket(DAT_1426280F0, 0, 0x28, &local_28);
```

Notes:
- The immediate opcode is `0x28`.
- The payload pointer is `&local_28`, which includes 4×u32 values; the function also stores `param_6` as an 8-byte value (commonly adjacent in the layout for the full 24 bytes).
- This matches a 24B structure: 16 bytes of four u32s plus 8 bytes (pointer/handle or 64-bit field).

## Payload (current understanding)

Observed layout at this site:
```
struct CMSG_0x0028_Payload {
    uint32_t p1;   // from param_1
    uint32_t p2;   // from param_2
    uint32_t p3;   // from param_3
    uint32_t p4;   // from param_4
    uint64_t q;    // from param_6 (pointer/handle-like)
}; // sizeof = 24 bytes
```

Open questions:
- Exact semantics of p1..p4 and q (IDs, coordinates, flags, pointer, timestamp).
- If other emitters reorder or omit any fields.

## Confidence

- Opcode: High (direct `QueuePacket(..., 0x28, ...)`).
- Size/shape: High for this emitter (4×u32 + 1×u64).
- Field semantics: Unknown.
