# CMSG_0x001A_LANDED

**Direction**: Client -> Server
**Status**: Confirmed (Schema-Driven, Live-Validated)

## Summary

This packet is sent by the client when the player character lands on the ground after a jump or fall. It communicates the final landing position and state to the server.

## Construction Chain

This packet is generated by the unified "Movement State Change" pipeline, the same one responsible for starting and stopping movement.

1.  **Data Aggregation (`FUN_1410225DE`):** The master movement aggregator function is called with parameters indicating a "Landed" event. It gathers the player's final landing position and other state data.
2.  **Generic Builder Chain:** The aggregator calls down the standard chain of generic builders.
3.  **Serialization (`CMSG::BuildAndSendPacket`):** The final builder calls the main serialization engine, which uses the schema for opcode `0x001A` to build the packet.
4.  **Sending Mechanism (Buffered Stream):** The packet is written to the main `MsgSendContext` buffer and sent in a batch when `MsgConn::FlushPacketBuffer` is called.

## Schema Information

- **Opcode:** `0x001A`
- **Schema Address (Live):** `0x7FF6E0EA66F0`

## Packet Structure (Decoded from Schema)

The schema defines a complex 12-field structure containing detailed information about the player's state upon landing. This accounts for the large 83-byte size observed in live traffic.

| Field # | Typecode | Data Type (Inferred) | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `0x01` | `short` | A subtype or sequence ID. |
| 2 | `0x04` | Compressed `int` | A timestamp or server tick. |
| 3 | `0x02` | `byte` | A flag or state byte. |
| 4 | `0x09` | `float[4]` | A 4-component vector, likely the character's rotation quaternion. |
| 5 | `0x04` | Compressed `int` | An ID or state value. |
| 6 | `0x09` | `float[4]` | A second 4-component vector, purpose unknown. |
| 7 | `0x09` | `float[4]` | A third 4-component vector, purpose unknown. |
| 8 | `0x02` | `byte` | A flag or state byte. |
| 9 | `0x02` | `byte` | A flag or state byte. |
| 10 | `0x01` | `short` | An ID or state value. |
| 11 | `0x03` | `int` | An ID or state value. |
| 12 | `0x04` | Compressed `int` | An ID or state value. |
