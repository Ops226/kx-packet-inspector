# CMSG 0x0012 â€” MOVEMENT / Unknown

Status: Confirmed. This opcode has multiple uses.

## Summary

CMSG `0x0012` is a multi-purpose opcode. Live traffic shows it being used for a standard player movement update. However, the schema tables define a much more complex packet for the same opcode.

### Variant A: Simple Movement Packet (Live Traffic)

Live logs and analysis of the project's `PacketParser.cpp` file confirm a simple, 24-byte packet is sent frequently during player movement.

**Packet Structure (Live, Confirmed):**

| Offset (from start) | Size (bytes) | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 2 | Opcode | `0x0012` |
| 2 | 6 | Header Data | Contains sequence numbers or timestamps. |
| 8 | 12 | **Position** | **(X, Y, Z coordinates)** |
| 20 | 4 | Trailer Data | Unknown purpose. |

**Evidence (`PacketParser.cpp`):**
```cpp
// The parser reads 3 floats starting 16 bytes from the end of the packet data.
const uint8_t* floatStart = data.data() + data.size() - 16;
std::memcpy(&payload.x, floatStart, sizeof(float) * 3);
```

### Variant B: Unknown Complex Packet (Schema-Defined)

The CMSG-to-Schema resolution table defines a very different, complex structure for this opcode, which includes two `float[3]` vectors.

- **Schema Address (Live):** `0x7FF6E0EA50B0`

**Packet Structure (Schema-Defined):**
A complex 11-field structure.

## Conclusion

The opcode `0x0012` is overloaded. The simple 24-byte variant seen in logs is a standard `MOVEMENT` packet. The purpose of the complex, schema-defined variant is unknown.
