# CMSG 0x0011 â€” HEARTBEAT / Unknown

Status: Confirmed. This opcode has multiple uses.

## Summary

CMSG `0x0011` is a multi-purpose opcode. Live traffic analysis shows it being used for a simple heartbeat, but the schema tables define a much more complex packet for it, suggesting it's used for at least two different purposes.

### Variant A: Heartbeat (Live Traffic)

Live logs confirm that a simple 4-byte packet with this opcode is sent periodically. This aligns perfectly with the `HEARTBEAT` name.

**Log Entries:**
```
18:38:36.896 [S] CMSG_HEARTBEAT Op:0x0011 | Sz:4 | 11 00 00 00
18:39:08.896 [S] CMSG_HEARTBEAT Op:0x0011 | Sz:4 | 11 00 28 00
```

**Packet Structure (Live):**
| Offset | Type | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | `uint16` | opcode_echo | Seems to be the opcode `0x0011` itself. |
| 0x02 | `uint16` | value | A changing value, purpose TBD. |

### Variant B: Unknown Complex Packet (Schema-Defined)

The CMSG-to-Schema resolution table defines a very different, complex structure for this opcode. This packet variant has not been observed in live traffic yet.

- **Schema Address (Live):** `0x7FF6E0EA4FB0`

**Packet Structure (Schema-Defined):**
A complex 11-field structure containing integers, an array, and a `float[3]` vector.

## Conclusion

The opcode `0x0011` is overloaded. The simple 4-byte variant is confirmed to be a heartbeat. The purpose of the complex, schema-defined variant is unknown.
