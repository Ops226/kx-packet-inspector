# CMSG 0x0004 â€” Unknown

Status: Schema address confirmed. Structure decoded. Name and purpose are unknown.

## Summary

This packet has opcode `0x0004`. Its purpose is currently unknown.

## Evidence

- **Opcode:** `0x0004`
- **Schema Address (Live):** `0x7FF6E0EA0D00`

## Packet Structure

Based on a full 512-byte dump of the schema. The schema defines a packet with 12 fields.

| Field Order | Type | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `short` | field_0 | Typecode: 0x01 |
| 2 | Small Array | field_1 | Typecode: 0x11 |
| 3 | Compressed `int` | field_2 | Typecode: 0x04 |
| 4 | `byte` | field_3 | Typecode: 0x02 |
| 5 | Optional Block | field_4 | Typecode: 0x0F |
| 6 | `short` | field_5 | Typecode: 0x01 |
| 7 | Small Array | field_6 | Typecode: 0x11 |
| 8 | Compressed `int` | field_7 | Typecode: 0x04 |
| 9 | `byte` | field_8 | Typecode: 0x02 |
| 10 | Optional Block | field_9 | Typecode: 0x0F |
| 11 | `short` | field_10 | Typecode: 0x01 |
| 12 | `long long` | field_11 | Typecode: 0x05 |

## Analysis

The user community hypothesized this opcode could be `MOVEMENT_END`. However, the schema defines a highly complex, 12-field structure with multiple arrays and optional blocks. This structure seems overly complex for a simple "end of movement" message. The packet's true purpose is likely something more sophisticated and remains to be identified.

## Confidence

- Opcode: High
- Schema Address: High
- Structure: High (Complete schema decoded)
- Name: Unknown (Hypothesis of `MOVEMENT_END` is unlikely)
