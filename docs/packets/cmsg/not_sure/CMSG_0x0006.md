# CMSG 0x0006 â€” Multi-purpose (Empty or Short)

Status: Confirmed. This opcode has multiple uses.

## Summary

CMSG `0x0006` is a multi-purpose opcode. Different code paths in the client send this packet with different payloads.

### Variant A: Empty Payload

This variant is sent with a null payload pointer and is used in at least two contexts:
1.  As a generic, unknown empty message from `CMSG_Build_0x0006_Empty`.
2.  As a conditional ping response from `CMSG::BuildPingResponse` (see [CMSG_PING_RESPONSE_0x0006.md](./CMSG_PING_RESPONSE_0x0006.md)).

**Evidence (`CMSG_Build_0x0006_Empty`):**
```
MsgConn::QueuePacket(DAT_1426280F0, 0, 6, 0); // payload is 0
```

### Variant B: Schema-Defined (Single Short)

The CMSG-to-Schema resolution table defines a structure for this opcode, indicating it can also be sent with a 2-byte payload.

- **Schema Address (Live):** `0x7FF6E0EA0FB0`

#### Packet Structure (Schema-Defined)

| Offset | Type | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | `short` | value | Typecode: 0x01 |

**Evidence (Schema Analysis):**
Analysis of the schema at the address above shows a single entry with typecode `0x01` (`short`), followed immediately by a terminator entry (`0x18`).

## Conclusion

The existence of both direct-send functions with an empty payload and a defined schema suggests this opcode is overloaded. The context of the game state determines which version of the packet is sent.
