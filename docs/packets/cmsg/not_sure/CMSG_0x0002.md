# CMSG 0x0002 â€” Unknown (Multi-variant)

Status: Confirmed. This opcode has multiple, unrelated uses.

## Summary

CMSG `0x0002` is a multi-purpose opcode. Live traffic shows it being used for a very simple, variable-length packet. However, the schema tables define a much more complex, 11-field packet for the same opcode.

### Variant A: Simple Packet (Live Traffic)

Live logs confirm a simple packet that is either 3 or 7 bytes long. Its purpose is unknown.

**Log Entries:**
```
19:36:28.883 [S] CMSG_UNKNOWN Op:0x0002 | Sz:3 | 02 00 10
19:36:49.003 [S] CMSG_UNKNOWN Op:0x0002 | Sz:7 | 02 00 10 11 00 00 00
```

**Packet Structure (Live):**
This packet appears to have a 3-byte base and an optional 4-byte integer.
*   **Base (3 bytes):** `ushort opcode_echo`, `byte field_0`
*   **Optional (4 bytes):** `int field_1`

### Variant B: Unknown Complex Packet (Schema-Defined)

The CMSG-to-Schema resolution table defines a very different, complex structure for this opcode. This packet variant has not been observed in live traffic yet.

- **Schema Address (Live):** `0x7FF6E0E9FD40`

**Packet Structure (Schema-Defined):**
A complex 11-field structure containing multiple arrays, integers, and a wide string.

## Conclusion

The opcode `0x0002` is overloaded. The simple variant seen in logs is likely built by a specialized function. The purpose of the complex, schema-defined variant is unknown.
