# CMSG 0x0024 â€” Unknown (44-byte aggregate payload)

Status: Confirmed opcode and total payload size. Name TBD.

## Summary

A Client-to-Server packet with opcode `0x0024` is emitted with a 44-byte (0x2C) payload, built from fields aggregated out of a node-like structure.

## Evidence

Emitter: CMSG_Build_0x0024_BufferLen44_FromNode @ 0x140239030

Decompiled highlights:
```
... locate node uVar1 ...

// copy fields out of node into local buffer
local_38 = *(u32*)(uVar1 + 0x40);
local_34 = *(u32*)(uVar1 + 0x44);
local_30 = *(u32*)(uVar1 + 0x48);
local_2c = *(u32*)(uVar1 + 0x4C);
local_28 = *(u32*)(uVar1 + 0x50);
local_24 = *(u64*)(uVar1 + 0x54);
uStack_1c = *(u64*)(uVar1 + 0x5C);

// set size and send
local_58 = 0x2C;
MsgConn::QueuePacket(DAT_1426280F0, 0, 0x24, &local_40);
```

Notes:
- The immediate opcode is `0x24`.
- The size constant `local_58 = 0x2C` confirms the payload length of 44 bytes.
- The payload buffer begins at `&local_40` and is composed of five u32s followed by two u64s, copied from offsets 0x40..0x5C of the source node.

## Payload (current understanding)

Observed layout (as packed at this site):
```
struct CMSG_0x0024_Payload {
    uint32_t a;    // node+0x40
    uint32_t b;    // node+0x44
    uint32_t c;    // node+0x48
    uint32_t d;    // node+0x4C
    uint32_t e;    // node+0x50
    uint64_t f;    // node+0x54
    uint64_t g;    // node+0x5C
}; // sizeof = 4*5 + 8*2 = 44 bytes
```

Open questions:
- Semantic meaning of each field (IDs, coords, flags, timestamps, etc.).
- Whether other emitters vary the composition of this 44-byte block.

## Confidence

- Opcode: High (direct `QueuePacket(..., 0x24, ...)`).
- Size: High (explicit 0x2C).
- Field order: High for this emitter (direct copy sequence). Semantics unknown.
