# KX Packet Inspector Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the KX Packet Inspector project.

This repository aims to provide a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing network communication in Guild Wars 2. This documentation serves as a central hub for all reverse engineering findings, methodologies, and technical insights gained during the development of this tool.

## Documentation Structure

*   **[System Architecture](./system-architecture.md):** A high-level overview of the entire network message dispatch system.
*   **[Packets](./packets):** Detailed, evidence-backed analysis of specific packet families and their variants.
*   **[Methodologies](./methodologies):** Guides and playbooks for reverse engineering the game client.

## Getting Started

*   To understand the overall network architecture, start with **[System Architecture](./system-architecture.md)**.
*   For a quick overview of all documented packets, see the **[Packet Reference](./packets/packet-reference.md)**.
*   For detailed information on specific packets, see the **[Packets](./packets)** directory.
*   For our advanced, static-analysis-driven process, consult the **[Packet Parser Discovery Playbook](./methodologies/packet-parser-discovery-playbook.md)**.
*   As a supplementary technique, see the **[Memory Correlation Workflow](./methodologies/memory-correlation-workflow.md)** for validating findings with live memory.

We hope this documentation provides valuable insights and aids in your exploration of Guild Wars 2's internals.
