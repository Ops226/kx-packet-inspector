# KX Packet Inspector Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the KX Packet Inspector project.

This repository aims to provide a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing network communication in Guild Wars 2. This documentation serves as a central hub for all reverse engineering findings, methodologies, and technical insights gained during the development of this tool.

## What You'll Find Here

*   **Reverse Engineering Findings:** Dive deep into the structure of Guild Wars 2's network protocol, including detailed packet layouts, handler chains, and architectural discoveries. Start with `ReverseEngineering.md` for a comprehensive overview.
*   **Methodologies:** Learn the techniques and strategies employed for successful reverse engineering of complex game binaries. Explore the `methodologies/` folder for guides like the `packet-parser-discovery-playbook.md`.
*   **Raw Decompilations:** Access raw C code output from Ghidra for in-depth analysis and verification in the `raw_decompilations/` folder.

## Getting Started

If you're looking to understand how Guild Wars 2 network packets work, begin by reading `ReverseEngineering.md`.

For developers looking to contribute or understand the reverse engineering process, consult `methodologies/packet-parser-discovery-playbook.md`.

We hope this documentation provides valuable insights and aids in your exploration of Guild Wars 2's internals.
